# DinoGame

This is a really simple game made with [Kotlin Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html) and [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) where Dino must avoid being hit by cactus.

### How to play
Run `./gradlew assemble` and launch `DinoGame.kexe` inside `../build/bin/native/debugExecutable/DinoGame.kexe`

### Thanks
Inspired by [KotlinConf 2018 - Live Coding Kotlin/Native Snake by Dmitry Kandalov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-gdJQeOVAk) and [GDG Pisa Live Meetup - Kotlin vs Kovid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1xIp-DG2aw) and of course by "The Dinosaur Game" in the Google Chrome web browser.
